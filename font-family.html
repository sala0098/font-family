<h1 style="color: aqua"> Attacked By A Squirrel</h1>
    
<p>Yesterday &lt;text&gt; I was walking down the street and tripped over a squirrel. Fortunately it didn't really hurt me physically BUT it did hurt my feelings a tremendous amount.
</p>
<p>The squirrel stared at me for a brief moment before skittering away into some nearby bushes. Thinking I was completely alone I felt the strange urge to cry. My nose started to sting and I could feel the tears well up but I decided that this time, I wouldn't!
